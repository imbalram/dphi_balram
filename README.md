React is a very popular front-end open-source JavaScript framework developed by Facebook for building stylish and advanced user interfaces. Combining with Node.js for server-side functionality, it allows for the development of full-stack applications and boasts a large array of support libraries that can be incorporated for added functionality. Using React cuts dev time exponentially, and as a result, it has been a popular choice for startups seeking to rapidly go to market with a sleek full-featured product. In this workshop, we’ll use React and Node.js to code a note-taking app in the free Visual Studio Code IDE. We’ll walk you through all the steps for coding and deploying a fully functioning web app in no time.
